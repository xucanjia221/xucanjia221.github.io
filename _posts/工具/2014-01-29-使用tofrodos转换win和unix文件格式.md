What is Tofrodos?
Tofrodos is a text file conversion utility that converts ASCII and Unicode UTF-8 files between the MSDOS (or Windows) format, which traditionally have CR/LF (carriage return/line feed) pairs as their new line delimiters, and the Unix format, which usually have LFs (line feeds) to terminate each line.
It is a useful utility to have around when you have to convert files between MSDOS (or Windows) and Unix/Linux/BSD (and her clones and variants). It comes standard with a number of systems and is often found on the system as "todos", "fromdos", "dos2unix" and "unix2dos".
